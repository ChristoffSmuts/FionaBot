Okay

Now we are going to add a to do list maker to fiona

A to do list is saved to local storage in the browser
lets call this todolistarr as a array

When user ask Fiona the following

To do list

To do list please

what do I have to do 

or bring up my to do list

fiona will respond with Fiona: And listing out the items in the array

1 item
2 item 
3 item 

When user say, add (something) to my to do list

Fiona pushes the item to the to do list and reads out the to dolist again

and then says the last item that has been added to the to do list

like this has been added

dont add add or remove words to the array these are commands 

don't add to do list to the array either

If you say remove or completed and it contains the item in the array in the same input that item is removed and Fiona Replies with the full to do list and state the item that has been removed as

(item) has been removed.
